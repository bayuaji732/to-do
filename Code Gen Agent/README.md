# AI Agent Code Generator

This repository contains my own implementation of an AI agent–based code generator, created as a learning project.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to explore how autonomous or semi-autonomous AI agents can be used to generate code based on user input. The implementation focuses on understanding agent workflows, prompt structuring, and interaction with large language models.

This project is intended for educational and experimental purposes.
