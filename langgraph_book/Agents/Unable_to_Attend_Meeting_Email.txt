Subject: Unable to Attend Meeting

Hi Tom,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to let you know that I cannot make it to the meeting scheduled for 10:00 AM at Canary Wharf. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

However, I can make it at 12:00 PM in New York the next day. Please let me know if this works for you or if there's anything I can catch up on later.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

Bayu Aji
